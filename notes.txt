Note: WE CAN AUTOMATE BROWSER IN TWO WAYS USING NODE.JS
1: SILENIUM  : VERY RARELY USED
2: PUPPETEER : IT IS AN OPENSOURCE LIBRARY USED IN AUTOMATION(IT INSTALL CHROMIUM BROWSER WITH IT)

IN NODE.JS FOR AUTOMATION THERE IS MODULE CALLED PUPPETEER
WITH PUPPETEER CHROMIUM BROWSER IS INSTALLED

CHROMIUM BROWSER : IT IS AN OPEN SOURCE BROWSER AND IT IS DEVELOPED BY GOOGLE
CHROME : THIS IS FOR NORMAL USER(IT'S CODE IS NOT OPEN AND IT'S CODE IS DERIVED BY CHROMIUM BROWSER)
CANARI : IT IS UPDATE DAILY AND IT IS NIGHTLY BUILT

WORKING : NODE.JS --> PUPPETEER  --> CHROMIUM  --> (IN CHROMIUM AUTOMATION STARTED)
